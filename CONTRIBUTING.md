### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea to make the project better? We'd love to hear it! ✨

**Before submitting:**
- Make sure you're using the latest version

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](https://github.com/NowaraJS/typed-event-emitter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/NowaraJS/typed-event-emitter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.
